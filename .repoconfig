;=======================================================================================
; Hi! This is repository configuration file.
; Anything prefixed by ';' is treated as comment.
; This file dictates what actions are available on the repository.
; (Press that "Actions" button on the bottom-left side of the repository browser.)
;
; If this is your own repository, you can configure this file to suit your needs.
; 
; Each action starts with [actionHandle]
; Afterwards, you can pass the following parameters:
; * displayName:
;     [OPTIONAL] The text to display on the "Actions" button.
;     If you don't specify this, this action won't be listed in the "Actions button",
;     but can still be called using AJAX call.
; * requiredRole:
;     [OPTIONAL] Minimum course role to be able to execute the action
;     If none specified, all course participants assigned to the repo can execute it.
; * simulatorHandle:
;     [OPTIONAL] What simulator handle to be used (e.g. 'minui-answer-ferdinand')
;     If specified, the simulator page will be displayed in a new tab.
; * arguments[]:
;     [OPTIONAL] list of arguments to be used, this will be set as environment
;     variable before the commands are executed, so you can call it in the `commands[]`
;     section like this: "$argumentName". 
; * commands[]:
;     [OPTIONAL] list of bash commands to be executed. If more than one command is
;     given, the whole command will be executed as: `CMD1 && CMD2 && ...`
; * isSeparator:
;     [OPTIONAL] If this is set to "true", all other parameters will be ignored and
;     a separator line will be displayed in its place.
